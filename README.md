# pi_gif
The aim of this project is to generate an animated image representing an approximation of pi

## Part one : `approximate.py`
- Executable file to approximate π by the Monte Carlo method
- Module providing to `draw.py` with a random list of points and their membership in the unit circle

## Part two : `draw.py`
- Generates ppm images representing random points and the approximation of π
- Generates a gif based on the ppm images
